The Eudyptula Challenge aims to teach participants the basics of Linux Device Driver programming. The method is to provide users a set of challenges, upon who's completion subsequent challenges are sent across. By the end of the Challenges, users are expected to have a strong basic understanding of kernel programming, their syntax and proper usage.
